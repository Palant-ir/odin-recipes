    <h3>Description Of the Scrambled Eggs</h3>
    <p>
        This simple air fryer eggs on the go recipe allows you to have a warm protein-packed meal to kick-start your day 
        while your coffee is brewing. I like to place 2 fully cooked turkey sausage links in the basket alongside the ramekin for an added boost of energy.

        <li>cooking spray</li>
